This is a very simple quick-start with python plotly lib based on [tutorial](https://plot.ly/python/plot-data-from-csv/)
but refactored to use plotly offline as described [here](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#initialization-for-offline-plotting).

The `sample-data.csv` is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/documentation/72f2384955e6678b5f37ce12ef257dd5752229a5/_posts/python/databases/plot-csv/sample-data.csv)
